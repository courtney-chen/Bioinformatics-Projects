### This module practices function and STDIN. 

### Problem 1 and 2 uses the basic function to print out the result of different types of function. 

### Problem 3 integrates functions and arguments to list out all kmers in a DNA sequence, and calculate the GC content in each kmer.

### Problem 4 is similar to problem 3. Instead of inputing a DNA sequence directly, it opens a fasta file and use that as the sequence for generating kmers and its corresponding GC content. 

### Problem 5 script calculate the hamming distance of 2 input arguments.

### Problem 6 use the fabonacci function to calculate the growth of C. elegans.
