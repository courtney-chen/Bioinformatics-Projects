# KEGG and GO

#### Zhibin Chen

### In this assignment, we first obtained the KEGG IDs with UniProt ID using the script â€œgetOneKegg.sh". After having the KEGG IDs, we used it to find the KO with "getOneKo.sh". Having the KEGG Orthology database ID, we can get the KEGG pathways associated with a KEGG ortholog by "getOnePath.sh". The script "getPathDesc.sh" helps to get all KO pathways' KEGG pathway descriptions. "get_kegg_ids.py" script specifies independent species KO entries. With the KO entries, we can use the script "get_ko.py" to obtain the KEGG pathways. At last, we merge the tabular files, which are the outputs from previous script -- kegg.txt, ko.txt, path.txt. R Script is run to characterize the KEGG data with the script "mergeAll.R".
