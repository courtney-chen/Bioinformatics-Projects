# for readability, it's a good idea to limit the length of lines of code to 80 characters

# for long command, can use the line continuation operator to do this

echo "This is a very long command. It is too long to fit within 80 characters \
so I use backslash to continue on the next line."
# after the backslash, enter to next line
