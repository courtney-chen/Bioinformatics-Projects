## Method
In this module we identify the differential expression of genes. Two main steps are involved to achive it -- retreive the data of relative abundance of transcripts, then apply statistical models to examine the differential expression between treatment groups.

In the first step, Salmon [@Patro] is used to estimate the relative abundance of transcripts. With the help of tximport [@Soneson], data can be imported for DESeq2 [@Love] to achive teh second step, running the statistical test.


## Results
```{R, code=readLines("de.R"), echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
```
